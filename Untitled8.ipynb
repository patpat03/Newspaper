Something about portraying Leo, a sad-sack test-marketer, appealed to Mr. Riegert, who gets to let out artistic wails along the lines of ''For this measly corporate job, I wasted decades of my life.'' Viewers on the receiving end of such wails will sympathize with Leo in only a limited way: ''For this measly movie, I wasted 90 minutes of mine.''\", \"  This modest independent film with a spectacular cast succeeds in conveying a depth of suburban dread that even its new-horizon ending cannot assuage. Leo is kindly toward a Sammy Glick-like deputy, only to see his ideas stolen by the curly-haired young sneak. Leo is vulnerable to age and burnout, but he's also creating his own vulnerabilities. He shirks work duties in New York for filial ones, visiting his fading father in the Southwest with expensive regularity.\", \"Meanwhile, his home life seems not particularly stressful, given that he shares his comfortable suburban house with a lovely, thoughtful wife (Isabella Rossellini) and a bright, attractive daughter (Ashley Johnson). Their calm is upset first by the teenager's bold flouting of her curfew -- horrors! -- and then by Leo's self-indulgent romp with an old flame.\", \"  Beverly D'Angelo pops up as the high-school crush with no apparent interest in Leo or compatibility with him, but she agrees to a hotel assignation with him anyway. In one of two wince-inducing episodes of logorrhea, Leo drifts into a post-coital confrontation with the woman's husband and gets the punches that he has been deserving for many minutes. This is the film's only moment of catharsis.\", \"  More familiar faces arrive among the accomplished cast members, who are stuck in the same glacially paced proceedings. As Leo's widowed dad, Eli Wallach presides as an irascible codger. As Gramps's gal pal, Rita Moreno offers her brand of brassy authority. Eric Bogosian crops up as an oddball rabbi.\", '  There are kooks aplenty, but the film, like a store-bought matzo, is destined never to rise. Mr. Riegert has assembled a capable cast with too little to do or say in this dry, crumbly, barely nourishing tale of intergenerational woe.', \"  ''King of the Corner'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for coarse language and sexual situations.\", '', 'King of the Corner', 'Opens tomorrow in Manhattan.', '', \"Directed by Peter Riegert; written by Gerald Shapiro and Mr. Riegert, based on the book ''Bad Jews and Other Stories'' by Mr. Shapiro; director of photography, Mauricio Rubinstein; edited by Mario Ontal; music by Al Kooper; production designer, Benjamin Conable; produced by Lemore Syvan; released by Elevation FilmWorks.

      "   The New York Times August 20, 2005 Saturday, Late Edition - Final  \n",
      "Copyright 2005 The New York Times Company Section: Section B; Column 5; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg. 10; FILM REVIEW Length: 522 words Byline: By NED MARTEL Body   The feature directing debut of the gifted actor Peter Riegert, ''King of the Corner'' comes from a fiction collection titled ''Bad Jews and Other Stories'' by Gerald Shapiro. Something about portraying Leo, a sad-sack test-marketer, appealed to Mr. Riegert, who gets to let out artistic wails along the lines of ''For this measly corporate job, I wasted decades of my life.'' Viewers on the receiving end of such wails will sympathize with Leo in only a limited way: ''For this measly movie, I wasted 90 minutes of mine.''   This modest independent film with a spectacular cast succeeds in conveying a depth of suburban dread that even its new-horizon ending cannot assuage. Leo is kindly toward a Sammy Glick-like deputy, only to see his ideas stolen by the curly-haired young sneak. Leo is vulnerable to age and burnout, but he's also creating his own vulnerabilities. He shirks work duties in New York for filial ones, visiting his fading father in the Southwest with expensive regularity. Meanwhile, his home life seems not particularly stressful, given that he shares his comfortable suburban house with a lovely, thoughtful wife (Isabella Rossellini) and a bright, attractive daughter (Ashley Johnson). Their calm is upset first by the teenager's bold flouting of her curfew -- horrors! -- and then by Leo's self-indulgent romp with an old flame.   Beverly D'Angelo pops up as the high-school crush with no apparent interest in Leo or compatibility with him, but she agrees to a hotel assignation with him anyway. In one of two wince-inducing episodes of logorrhea, Leo drifts into a post-coital confrontation with the woman's husband and gets the punches that he has been deserving for many minutes. This is the film's only moment of catharsis.   More familiar faces arrive among the accomplished cast members, who are stuck in the same glacially paced proceedings. As Leo's widowed dad, Eli Wallach presides as an irascible codger. As Gramps's gal pal, Rita Moreno offers her brand of brassy authority. Eric Bogosian crops up as an oddball rabbi.   There are kooks aplenty, but the film, like a store-bought matzo, is destined never to rise. Mr. Riegert has assembled a capable cast with too little to do or say in this dry, crumbly, barely nourishing tale of intergenerational woe.   ''King of the Corner'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for coarse language and sexual situations.  King of the Corner Opens tomorrow in Manhattan.  Directed by Peter Riegert; written by Gerald Shapiro and Mr. Riegert, based on the book ''Bad Jews and Other Stories'' by Mr. Shapiro; director of photography, Mauricio Rubinstein; edited by Mario Ontal; music by Al Kooper; production designer, Benjamin Conable; produced by Lemore Syvan; released by Elevation FilmWorks. At the Metro Twin, 2626 Broadway, at 99th Street. Running time: 93 minutes. This film is rated R.  WITH: Peter Riegert (Leo Spivak), Isabella Rossellini (Rachel Spivak), Eli Wallach (Sol Spivak), Rita Moreno (Inez), Beverly D'Angelo (Betsy Ingraham), Jake Hoffman (Ed Shifman), Ashley Johnson (Elena Spivak) and Eric Bogosian (Rabbi Evelyn Fink).  \n",
